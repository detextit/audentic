# Modern UI Design Principles

## Core Design Philosophy

Our UI design follows a clean, modern aesthetic that prioritizes usability, visual hierarchy, and consistent styling. These principles create a professional, cohesive experience across all components.

## Layout & Structure

1. **Card-Based Components**
   - Cards with subtle borders (border-border/40)
   - Light shadows (shadow-sm) with hover enhancement (hover:shadow)
   - Consistent padding (p-4) with slightly reduced padding for headers (pb-2)
   - Light background color for headers (bg-muted/20) to create visual separation
   - Rounded corners (default border-radius from theme)

2. **Spacing & Alignment**
   - Consistent gap spacing between elements (gap-2, gap-3)
   - Vertical rhythm with consistent spacing between sections (space-y-4, space-y-6)
   - Grid layouts for form controls (grid gap-3)
   - Padding increases with component hierarchy importance

3. **Container Organization**
   - Clear visual hierarchy with headers, content areas, and footers
   - Collapsible sections for complex content
   - Consistent width constraints (w-[350px] for sidebars)
   - Proper empty and loading states with centered content

## Typography

1. **Text Hierarchy**
   - Reduced heading sizes for better proportion (text-lg for section titles)
   - Descriptive text in muted colors (text-muted-foreground)
   - Smaller font sizes for descriptions (text-xs)
   - Consistent text sizes across similar elements (text-sm for inputs)
   - Line clamping for long text (line-clamp-1)

2. **Font Styling**
   - Medium font weight for headers (font-medium)
   - Regular weight for body text
   - Subtle text colors for secondary information

## Interactive Elements

1. **Buttons & Controls**
   - Smaller button sizes for secondary actions (size="sm")
   - Consistent height for inputs (h-9, h-8)
   - Hover states for all interactive elements
   - Clear focus states with subtle rings (focus-visible:ring-1)
   - Dashed borders for "add" actions

2. **Form Elements**
   - Reduced height inputs (h-8, h-9) for better density
   - Subtle background colors (bg-muted/50)
   - Consistent placeholder text
   - Clear labeling with smaller font sizes
   - Visual grouping of related controls

3. **Navigation & Selection**
   - Active states with primary color backgrounds (bg-primary/10)
   - Hover states with subtle background changes (hover:bg-muted/30)
   - Consistent cursor styling (cursor-pointer)
   - Clear visual feedback for current selection

## Visual Elements

1. **Icons & Imagery**
   - Consistent icon sizing (h-4 w-4 for standard, h-3.5 w-3.5 for compact)
   - Icons with circular backgrounds for emphasis
   - Primary color for important icons (text-primary)
   - Muted colors for secondary icons (text-muted-foreground)

2. **Color Usage**
   - Primary color for active/selected states
   - Muted colors for backgrounds and borders
   - Consistent color application across similar components
   - Subtle color variations for state changes (10% opacity for backgrounds)

3. **Borders & Dividers**
   - Light borders (border-border/40) for subtle separation
   - Vertical separators (w-px) between major sections
   - Border emphasis for active elements (border-primary/30)
   - Consistent border colors from theme variables

## Component-Specific Patterns

1. **Sidebars**
   - Fixed width (w-[350px])
   - Consistent header height (h-[72px])
   - Search functionality with icon positioning
   - Clear active states for selected items
   - Proper empty states with helpful messaging

2. **Lists & Collections**
   - Grouped items with clear headers
   - Consistent item styling with hover effects
   - Circular icon containers for visual interest
   - Truncation for long text with tooltips
   - Proper spacing between list items (space-y-1)

3. **Dialogs & Modals**
   - Clear headers with descriptive titles
   - Consistent button placement in footers
   - Proper spacing for form elements
   - Maximum width constraints for readability
   - Scrollable content with fixed headers/footers

4. **Form Sections**
   - Visual grouping of related fields
   - Clear labeling with required field indicators
   - Help text with tooltips for complex fields
   - Consistent input styling and sizing
   - Conditional display of related fields

## Responsive Considerations

1. **Adaptive Layouts**
   - Grid systems that adjust to available space
   - Collapsible navigation for smaller screens
   - Proper text truncation for constrained spaces
   - Consistent component sizing across viewports

2. **Mobile Optimizations**
   - Touch-friendly target sizes
   - Simplified layouts for smaller screens
   - Proper spacing for touch interactions
   - Consistent component behavior across devices

## Accessibility Principles

1. **Visual Clarity**
   - Sufficient color contrast for text
   - Clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
   - Consistent interactive patterns
   - Proper labeling for all interactive elements

2. **Semantic Structure**
   - Logical tab order for keyboard navigation
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Descriptive labels for form controls
   - Appropriate ARIA attributes where needed
